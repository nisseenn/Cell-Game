# Cell-Game
A Python command line game which simulate the life of cells

In short, the program should keep track of a board of any size, where each field
in the board contains a cell. A cell can be alive or dead. The simulation takes place
through multiple generations using regular updates, where cells die or live
depending on their surroundings.
